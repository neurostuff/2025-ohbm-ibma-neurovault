    "## IBMA: Image-based meta-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "IBMA, the gold standard of neuroimaging meta-analysis (Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2009; Salo et al., 2023), consists of aggregating results from group-level, whole-brain statistical maps from individually conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. IBMA outperforms other popular meta-analysis methods, such as coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA). IBMA methods use whole-brain statistics; thus, all existing voxel-wise statistical methods are available to analyze subject-level data within studies (Lazar et al., 2002). IBMA produces richer and more detailed results, with greater sensitivity to detect brain structures that are often absent from CBMA results. IBMA also has greater power; thus, one could potentially achieve similar or even better results with a small fraction of studies generally required in CBMA. In addition, when both the parameter (i.e., activation) and variance estimates are available, hierarchical mixed (random) effect models can be used to account for both within- and between-study variance (Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2009).\n",

    "Using the available metadata from the retrieved tables, we set different inclusion criteria for images to be considered for a meta-analysis. We focused on fMRI-BOLD images, as they are the most prevalent modality in NeuroVault. Note that the methods presented in this tutorial should work with other image modalities (e.g., PET, diffusion MRI, structural MRI). Still, only fMRI-BOLD had enough data in NeuroVault for meta-analyses. Then, we specifically chose images from group-level analyses. Additionally, we retained only images from studies with a sample size greater than ten subjects. Next, we selected images classified as T or Z statistics. Although best practices in meta-analysis suggest using meaningful units and incorporating uncertainty through standard errors, T/Z statistic maps are the most commonly shared images in NeuroVault (Maumet and Nichols, 2016). We discuss this further in the following sections. Following that, we retained unthresholded images that cover 40% of the brain and are in MNI space. Ultimately, we narrowed our selection to images associated with a Cognitive Atlas task.\n",

    "Even after applying the previous strict preliminary inclusion criteria, we still found plenty of incorrectly annotated images, especially representing other image modalities and others with extreme values. Therefore, we developed an automatic heuristic selection to remove those spurious images from the meta-analysis. The heuristic selection consisted of two steps. First, we removed all images from collections that lacked a link to a publication. Also, images with a minimum Z value (`zmin`) smaller than 1.96 (i.e., Z score for a 0.05 p-value) were removed as they potentially consisted of mislabeled correlation maps, inverted p-value maps, or did not contain statistically significant voxels. We also excluded images with a maximum Z score (`zmax`) larger than 20. Although the number 50 is arbitrary, we wanted to detect images with an unusually large signal. For example, mislabeled BOLD or COPE (contrast of parameter estimates) images or others resulting from studies with a huge sample size. Additionally, using the image metadata, we analyzed the image and file name. We removed those containing keywords such as \"ICA,\" \"PCA,\" \"PPI,\" \"seed,\" \"functional connectivity,\" “cope,” “tfce,” and \"correlation,\" which represent modalities not of interest for the meta-analysis of the current work. Example: https://neurovault.org/images/31938/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identify and exclude duplicate and inverted contrast images\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite common for NeuroVault users to upload inverted contrasts and duplicates. For example, one might find two images representing the same contrast (such as House > Face) but with the signs reversed (i.e., Face > House). Example of inverted contrasts in NeuroVault: [MAINFOOD_HCplus>HCmin](https://neurovault.org/images/123498/) and [MAINFOOD_HCmin>HCplus](https://neurovault.org/images/123499/). This creates problems for meta-analyses, as these images effectively cancel each other out when aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is typical for users to upload multiple images of the same contrast, differing only by the covariate used in the group-level analysis. These can be considered duplicates, especially when the covariate does not influence the final estimate. To identify duplicates, we utilize the correlation matrix of the input samples. Image pairs with a correlation close to 1 are considered duplicates, while those with a correlation close to -1 are labeled as inverted contrasts. From the identified duplicates, we randomly selected one image from each pair. For pairs of inverted contrasts, we choose the image with the more positive correlation to the median image.\n"

    "- **Assumption of independence:** We considered all images to be independent of each other. However, many NeuroVault images originate from the same paper or collection, and thus are not truly independent. This can lead to inflated false positive rates due to shared analytic pipelines or overlapping subject populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contrast heterogeneity:** The analysis may combine images representing different contrasts or experimental conditions. This heterogeneity can obscure or confound meta-analytic results. We recommend performing a manual review to select images corresponding to the specific contrast of interest for your research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata accuracy:** The inclusion criteria rely on metadata provided by NeuroVault contributors. Misannotations or incomplete metadata (e.g., incorrect map type, modality, or sample size) can result in inappropriate inclusion or exclusion of images.\n",

    "- **Residual spurious images:** Despite automated outlier and quality control steps, some spurious, mislabeled, or low-quality images may remain in the dataset, potentially biasing results.\n",

    "This tutorial demonstrated a complete workflow for performing image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) using open neuroimaging data from NeuroVault and the NiMARE Python library. We began by downloading and exploring NeuroVault metadata, then applied strict inclusion criteria to select appropriate group-level, unthresholded fMRI-BOLD statistical maps related to motor tasks. After downloading the usable images, we constructed a NiMARE Dataset and ran an IBMA workflow using Stouffer's method, including FDR correction and jackknife diagnostics. We also implemented additional quality control steps to remove spurious, duplicate, and inverted images, and repeated the meta-analysis on the cleaned dataset. The notebook provides a reproducible pipeline for robust IBMA, highlights best practices for data selection and cleaning, and generates both visual and tabular outputs to interpret the results."

    "# Next steps\n",

    "Before performing your meta-analysis, carefully review the following considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check for independence:** When selecting images, ensure that you do not include multiple images from the same collection or study unless justified, as this can violate the assumption of independence and inflate false positives.\n",
    "- **Refine contrast selection:** Manually inspect and select images representing the same experimental contrast or condition to reduce heterogeneity and improve interpretability.\n",
    "- **Verify metadata accuracy:** Cross-check metadata (e.g., map type, modality, sample size) with the original publications to avoid misannotations or incomplete information.\n",
    "- **Assess image quality:** Visually inspect statistical maps and exclude any that appear spurious, mislabeled, or of low quality, even after automated QC.\n",
    "- **Consider sample size reporting:** Be aware that missing or inaccurate sample size information can affect meta-analytic weighting; document any assumptions or imputations.\n",
    "- **Acknowledge generalizability:** The workflow was tested for group-level fMRI-BOLD Z/T maps in three domains (i.e., working memory, motor, and emotion processing); adapt criteria as needed for other modalities or domains.\n",
    "- **Be aware of publication bias:** Recognize that NeuroVault may not represent all studies, and results could be influenced by selective data sharing. \n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these points, you can enhance the rigor and reproducibility of your IBMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For your meta-analysis research, start by visiting the [Cognitive Atlas](https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/) database to identify your domain of interest. Choose specific tasks related to the selected area and evaluate the available data in NeuroVault.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the selected data, review the linked papers thoroughly to understand their methodologies and results. Ensure that you identify the contrasts of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This approach reflects the current best practices for IBMA using NeuroVault. Please note that this workflow will ultimately be integrated into [Neurosynth Compose](https://compose.neurosynth.org/) to streamline the meta-analysis process.\n"
